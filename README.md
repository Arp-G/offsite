TODO

streaming and browser download wont work( "no file" error) on chrome, works on firefox
simplify deps install currently I need to manually ssh and run: `chmod +x install_deps.sh && ./install_deps.sh`
Check if this exists: the data from transmission is not good enough, if torrent in paused and started the downloaded bytes goes wrong and eta also
Lots of areas to refactor to clean code: check one module at a time
dockerize and make readme also consider writing a blog
