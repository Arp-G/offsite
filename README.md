TODO

remove extension type check, "vid" extension also works
check if we can have transmission new ui or get rid of its files
For some reason torrent download only works through zip
For some reason only audio plays when streaming torrent stream
add a way to restart transmission daemon from ui
add auto install transmission and auto start daemon with proper download path
fix styling issues
playing torrent wont work since files have .part extensions
Check if this exists: the data from transmission is not good enough, if torrent in paused and started the downloaded bytes goes wrong and eta also
Lots of areas to refactor to clean code: check one module at a time
