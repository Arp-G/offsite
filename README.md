TODO

check if we can have transmission new ui or get rid of its files
auth for all routes including torrent
add a way to restart transmission daemon from ui
add auto install transmission and auto start daemon with proper download path
add zip download option
fix styling issues
Check if this exists: the data from transmission is not good enough, if torrent in paused and started the downloaded bytes goes wrong and eta also
Lots of areas to refactor to clean code: check one module at a time
